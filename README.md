# Stock-Algo

In this project, I've developed a trading algorithm that combines an equal-weight strategy with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the S&P 500.

## Introduction

Trading algorithms are a popular tool for automating the investment process, and this project focuses on creating a versatile algorithm for trading the S&P 500. The algorithm incorporates two main components: equal weight allocation and the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

### Equal Weight Algorithm

The equal weight algorithm assigns an equal portion of the investment to each stock in the S&P 500 index. This strategy aims to provide a balanced and diversified investment approach.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI is a momentum indicator that helps assess whether a stock or market is overbought or oversold. By incorporating RSI, our algorithm aims to make informed decisions based on market momentum.

## Features

- Equal weight allocation strategy for S&P 500 stocks.
- Integration of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for market momentum analysis.
